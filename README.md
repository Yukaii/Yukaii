# Hi! I'm Yukai Huang

Hi, my name is Yukai, which means "happiness" in Japanese (although it's a Chinese name).

I'm a developer who loves building projects focused on productivity or simply for fun.

The following list contains the projects I've built in recent years, and I update it occasionally.

Some earlier projects can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/Yukaii?tab=repositories). I publicly track work-in-progress projects and ideas on my [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/Yukaii/projects/3/views/3). I also create userscripts for browsers from time to time, which I share on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Yukaii).

You can also find me on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/yukaii_h), where I occasionally host live coding sessions.
